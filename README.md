# Day-Planner
Third-Party APIs Homework

USER STORY
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

BUSINESS CONTEXT
Poor time management can result in missed meetings and deadlines or create the appearance of unprofessionalism. A daily planner allows employees to see their day at a glance, schedule time effectively, and improve productivity.

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
Functional, deployed application.

GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.

The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.


GIVEN that an employee adds events to a specific hour in a calendar

WHEN the employee clicks the save button

THEN events are saved in the timeblock for that hour
